    "At first glance, this looks like the well known combinatoric problem of partitioning a set of $n$ indistibguishable items into $k$ distinguishable bins, which has a simple closed form solution. Going deeper, we see that there are some important differences. For example, we have the constraints that card values are limited to two through ten and no value can appear more than four times - if our target is 35, this excludes solutions based on sets of card values such as (1, 1, 1, 1, 31) and (7, 7, 7, 7, 7).\n",
