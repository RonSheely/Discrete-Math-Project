# Discrete math project

This repo contains materials to help high school math teachers and
their students get started programming in Python and then applying
what they learn to explore topics in discrete math. We hope in the
future to extend this to other math topics.

The content has been grouped into directories and we suggest starting
with the Introduction and working through the notebooks in
order. After covering the introductory materials, the other topics can
be taken in any order.

## Introduction

A series of notebooks that introduce the Python language, Jupyter
notebooks and markdown language. Also includes specialized topics,
such as combinations and permutations, that are fundamental to many
areas of discrete math.

## Cryptography reordering

Examples of cryptography techniques that are based on permuting,
scrambling or otherwise reordering letters.

## Iterations and recursions

Illustration of recursion techniques using well-known examples such as Fibonacci numbers

## Games

Examples of games such as Thai 21
