# Discrete math project

This repo contains materials to help high school math teachers and
their students get started programming in Python and then applying
what they learn to explore topics in discrete math. We hope in the
future to extend this to other math topics.

We recommend the following sequence.

+ Python intro for HS math - part 1
+ Python intro for HS math - part 2
+ Markdown
+ Math formatting
+ Python intro for HS math - part 3

## Python intro for HS math - part 1

This Notebook covers the basics of Python - math operations,
variables, Booleans and logic, comments, a very quick introduction to
NumPy, strings, lists and sets. It also introduces the Jupter Notebook
environment that we'll be using throughout these lessons.

## Python intro for HS math - part 2

Picks up where we left off earlier and covers decision making, loops,
functions, modules and Python's help facility.

## Markdown

Jupyter Notebooks contain a mixture of executable code and markdown
cells. We've been using markdown all along, but without going into any
details. This Notebook covers markdown in more depth and describes
headers, italic and bold text, code syntax and escaping. This Notebook
and the one on math formatting are not specific to Python and make a
nice break after the programming topics.

## Math formatting

Extends the markdown syntax by showing how to incorporate math
formatting, such as subscripts and superscripts, square roots, math
symbols, integrals, sums, Greek letters and matrices.

## Python intro for HS math - part 3

This Notebook finishes the introduction to Python and covers material
that may not be needed immediately, but does round out knowledge of
the language. Topics include dictionaries (key-value pairs), tuples,
iterators, deep copies and shallow copies, maps, working with files
and the Python standard library.
